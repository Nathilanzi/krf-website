      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        The VisionPlan 2035 is the heart of the community’s development strategy. It is designed to align traditional governance with modern socio-economic needs, ensuring that Tsitsing and the broader Royal Bafokeng Nation (RBN) continue to thrive. The plan is broken down into three key areas of action, each with specific goals.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Area 01: Human Individual Development</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The first goal of VisionPlan 2035 is to invest in the well-being of individuals, recognizing that the strength of the community lies in the strength of its people. The focus here is on providing opportunities for growth, ensuring that all individuals have access to the essentials for a dignified life.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-8">
        <li><strong>1.1 Healthy Individuals:</strong> Prioritizing healthcare initiatives, from basic medical access to preventative care. The community seeks to provide quality healthcare services to all residents, with special programs focusing on maternal health, child nutrition, and mental health awareness.</li>
        <li><strong>1.2 Individuals with Dignity:</strong> Every person deserves to live with dignity, and this aspect of the VisionPlan promotes social welfare programs that ensure the most vulnerable members of the community are supported. This includes initiatives aimed at eradicating poverty and providing support for the elderly, disabled, and those affected by crises.</li>
        <li><strong>1.3 Educated Individuals:</strong> Education is the cornerstone of individual and community development. This part of the plan promotes equal access to quality education for all members, from early childhood development to tertiary education and vocational training. Special attention is given to bridging the digital divide and providing students with the resources to succeed in the modern world.</li>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Area 02: Development of the Collective</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        While individual development is critical, VisionPlan 2035 recognizes the importance of building a strong, cohesive community. The plan focuses on creating an environment that fosters mutual respect, safety, and a shared identity.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-8">
        <li><strong>1.4 A Safe, Healthy, and Appealing Environment:</strong> This section deals with urban development, focusing on clean and sustainable infrastructure. Programs under this initiative aim to provide clean water, sanitation, safe housing, and accessible public spaces. It also includes environmental conservation efforts to preserve natural resources and promote eco-friendly practices.</li>
        <li><strong>1.5 A Valued Identity and Cultural Heritage:</strong> Preserving the unique identity and cultural heritage of Tsitsing and the RBN is a key part of VisionPlan 2035. Cultural programs focus on the revitalization of traditional practices, oral histories, and languages. Festivals, arts initiatives, and heritage projects serve as platforms for celebrating the community’s identity.</li>
        <li><strong>1.6 Good Governance and Leadership:</strong> Transparent and accountable governance is central to the success of any community. VisionPlan 2035 emphasizes the role of traditional leadership in creating a governance system that is participatory, inclusive, and fair. Regular consultations with community members, as well as efforts to involve youth in leadership roles, are critical aspects of this goal.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Area 03: Sustainability and Growth</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        VisionPlan 2035 aims to ensure that development is sustainable and leads to long-term growth. The community's resources—both natural and economic—must be managed responsibly to benefit both current and future generations.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-8">
        <li><strong>1.7 Stewardship of Our Resources:</strong> The community is committed to managing its land and natural resources responsibly. This includes sustainable agricultural practices, wildlife conservation, and initiatives aimed at reducing waste and pollution. VisionPlan 2035 promotes renewable energy and seeks to reduce the carbon footprint of the Tsitsing community.</li>
        <li><strong>1.8 Economic Opportunity:</strong> A thriving economy is essential for sustainable growth. This part of VisionPlan 2035 focuses on creating economic opportunities for all community members. Small business support, skills training programs, and partnerships with local and international businesses are key strategies. The goal is to build a diversified economy that can provide stable employment and growth opportunities.</li>
